Hi Sharon and Padraig,

I found a couple different xpp files.

I think the model on ModelDB by Bill Lytton is based on xpp files for a network of 2 coupled PR cells with interneurons that was in the attached paper BoothBose-Network2002.  This is the ode file booth_bose_pinrin.ode and the set files network*_pinrin.set

I also found xpp files for a single PR cell that we used for the attached chapter on somatic-dendritic  ping-pong bursting that is in the book Bursting: The Genesis of Rhythm in the Nervous System edited by Stephen Coombes and Paul Bresslof.  We made some simplifications to a time constant function in the PR model that are made in the  pinrin_simpletau*.ode files.

I haven't tried to run these files.  Let me know if you run into major problems with them.
Hope that helps!  Feel free to make them publically available.
Regards,
Victoria
